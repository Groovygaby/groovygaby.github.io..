		<h2>Fake News and the Real Life Consequences:</h2>
		<p> I want to create a website about the impact of Fake News and its real-life consequences. Essentially, I envision a website organized into sections, almost like the format of the 'Sinner' website we discussed in a lecture, if my web design skills allow. Each section will focus on a specific headline, such as 'Pizza Gate' or 'South Africa's Alcohol Ban.' When users click on these options, they'll find detailed information about the serious consequences that resulted from fake news related to these events.</br></br>

The primary goal is to educate people about the dangers of engaging with and spreading fake news, emphasizing the real-life repercussions it can have. This topic is highly relevant in today's digital age, and having all these stories on one website could serve as a wake-up call for people. I also plan to include some lighter examples to keep it engaging and not too heavy.</br></br>

Additionally, I'm considering adding a section on 'How to Spot Fake News' or something similar. This way, the website won't only focus on past events but will also provide guidance on preventing the spread of fake news in the future.</p>
		<h2> Task One:</h2>
		<h4> Audience and Importance of Topic:</h4>
		<p>My website is geared towards teenagers and young adults, specifically those who are students. This audience is a perfect fit because we're currently living in the digital age, where being informed and educated about fake news is crucial. Students, who are in the midst of their educational journey, are at a pivotal stage to learn about fake news. It's important to address this issue early to prevent the spread of misinformation. Given that students often use social media extensively, it's vital that they grasp the real-world consequences of interacting with and sharing false information<br><br>
		Students will not be new to this topic but they will definitely be eager to learn as most of them have a love for social media and so this will seem like a relevant and exciting topic to learn about. It is also a very practical topic where they can apply their lessons in the real world, it will benefit them massively by equipping them with the awareness they need to be safe online.

		<h2>Task Two:</h2>
		
		<ul>
				<li><b>Questions:</b></br> What are some notable examples of fake news stories and their consequences?</br>What are the real-life consequences of spreading or believing fake news?</br> Why is it important for students to be aware of fake news?</br>How can individuals spot fake news?</li>
				<li><b>Keywords:</b></br>Fake news, misinformation, Fake news examples, Impact of Fake News, Combating Fake News, </li>
				<li><b>Usefulness of search terms:</b></br> Yes I received good, useful information when using my keywords. However, the more specific I was when searching for information, the better the results were. Conversely, if you are too specific then you won't retrieve the information you want. This process will be a trial and error but my keywords are efficient.</li>
				<li><b>Irrelevant results:</b></br> Some irrelevant results are bound to appear when searching for information with keywords, you just need to sift through them by reading the abstracts of papers before committing to reading a paper in full. As mentioned previously, it's all about being specific and re-arranging your sentences or adding/removing certain words.</li>
				<li><b>Further Refinement:</b></br> Some further refinement is needed with my keywords, such as specifying which country I am looking for fake news. E.g. Fake news stories in South Africa. The only struggle I will have is that it would be easier to find examples of fake news stories from news websites like BBC News. However, academic journals have the potential to be out of date or too lengthy.</li>
